> [!WARNING]
> This is a **University Research Project** and **SHOULD NOT BE USED ON PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS**. The goal is to determine the feasibility, performance and developer experience of Rust Programming Language for implementing static code analyzers for Ballerina Language.

## Documentation

*   [BNF Grammar for Ballerina Subset](docs/BNF.md)
* [Software Requirement Specification (SRS)](https://github.com/RuztyCrabs/Blazelint/releases/latest/download/BlazeLint-SRS.pdf)
*   [Pipeline overview](docs/pipeline_overview.md)

## Installation

Install the latest published version from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/blazelint):

```bash
cargo install blazelint
```

Pre-build binaries are available for Linux from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/RuztyCrabs/Blazelint/releases/latest) and place it in your `$PATH`.

Windows and MacOS binaries will be added in next release.

## Usage

Analyze a Ballerina source file by passing its path to `blazelint`:

```bash
blazelint path/to/file.bal
```

> [!NOTE]
> Use the limited subset document in the [BNF](docs/BNF.md) when defining Ballerina syntax to be linted.

The tool prints the input program, a token stream, the parsed AST, and exits with a non-zero status or emits diagnostics if it detected any.

Running from a checked-out repository is also supported:

```bash
cargo run -- path/to/file.bal
```

> [!NOTE]
> `cargo run` builds and executes an unoptimized build (for debug requirments). Always use `cargo build --release` for any benchmark or observations on performance.

For a quick smoke test, you can reuse the sample program in `tests/test.bal`:

```bash
blazelint tests/test.bal
```

## Development environment

We provide a pre-configured [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/) that you can use to jump on to developing BlazeLint without installing anything locally. You can skip pre-requisites if you plan to use this. 

### Using GitHub Codespaces

Dev Container can be launched and used fully remotely inside a browser using GitHub codespaces:

1. Click **Code â†’ Create codespace** from the GitHub UI.
2. Wait for the Codespace to provision (first run will take some significant time).
3. Start Developing!

### Using VS Code (if you have it installed locally)

1. Install the **Dev Containers** extension.
2. Clone this repository and open it in VS Code.
3. Run the **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container** command.
4. Wait till the container spins up.
5. Start Developing!

The container comes with:

- Rust toolchain
- Typst CLI for building the SRS
- Ballerina runtime
- Extensions for Language Servers, syntax highlighting and debugging support
- Common utilities (zsh, GitHub CLI, git, etc.)
 
## Building

### Prerequsites

- Git 2.51.0 or newer
- Rust Toolchain 1.86.0 or newer [(Get it here)](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/)

### Steps

1. Create a fork and clone to local:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-profile-name>/Blazelint.git
```

2. `cd` into the directory:

```bash
cd Blazelint
```

3. Build with cargo:

```bash
cargo build --release
```
## Debugging

### Prerequsites

- Build requirements stated [here](#building).
- [VsCode IDE by Microsoft](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Rust Analyzer extension by rust-lang.org](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
- [CodeLLDB extension by Vadim Chugunov](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb)

### Steps
- You can adjust the `tests/test.bal` file if you need to debug a specific diagnostic.
- Set breakpoints as needed.
- Click on **Run and Debug** from the main method or use `ctrl+shift+D` to jump to debug menu.

> [!NOTE]
> It is possible to debug with any IDE including Neovim, Emacs and etc but we recommend vscode for easier setup. 

## Contributing

### Changes should be developed and push to following branches based on the area of the feature.

- feature/linter-core: Changes to the linter engine (lexer, parser, semantic analyzer and BNF document).
- ci/cd: Changes related to continous integration and deployments.
- docs: Changes related to documenation.

### Run all formatter, lint, and test checks locally before opening a pull request:

```bash
bash scripts/check.sh
```
